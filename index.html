				<strong>Insights about the data/visualization:</strong>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><Strong> Cyclic Nature of New Cases: </Strong> Thi graphic shows that the new cases tend to spike every 5-8 months. This is interesting since 
					most infectious diseases tend to have a seasonal pattern, but this data shows a more cyclic pattern</li>
				<li><Strong> Relatively Small Peaks leading Big Peaks: </Strong> The graphic shows that there is a consistent pattern of a smaller peak 
					before a larger peak. This is seen with the small July 2020 peak before the large January 2021 peak, and the September 2021 peak before 
					the even larger January 2022 peak.
				<li><Strong> Peaks </Strong> The highest peak seems to be at the edge of the datasets limits in January 2022, at an estimate 300K cases</li>
				<li><Strong> Troughs:</Strong> In terms of lowest new cases, June of the 2021 had the least amount of new cases. However, this led
				to large spike in September of 2021</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>Design Critique:</strong>
			</p>
			
			The visualization demonstrates several strengths, particularly in its use of a year-long cycle
			format which makes month-to-month and seasonal comparisons across years intuitive and accessible. Another strength is it's color, 
			which employs a soft red that is easy on the eyes and effectively differentiates the black center mean lines. Although color could be used 
			more strategically to enhance the message.  Additionally, the labeling is fairly clear and comprehensive, providing a well-communicated title 
			and legend to guide interpretation. 
			  
			  However, the visualization has areas for improvement. Quantifying exact values is challenging, as the design focuses more on 
			  general trends than precise numbers. The legend's range of values, which states a maximum of 150K cases, creates confusion, especially when 
			  peaks in January 2021 and January 2022 exceed this range, leaving it unclear whether the legend reflects the plot's maximum size or an upper 
			  limit surpassed by the data. The placement of the "7-day average" label within the data section also reduces its visibility and may cause 
			  confusion, as it seems misplaced and better suited within the title. Regarding the month labels, it may be difficult for a viewer to interpolate
			  months when only given 4 througout the year. This is dificult since the viewer would have think about more since months increase from 
			  right to left on the bottom half as opposed to right to left. Furthermore, the spiraled data format adds complexity, making it difficult
			   for the brain to follow patterns within a single year without inadvertently jumping to another year's data due to the overlapping circular and
			    radial directions.

			<h2><strong> Visualization Sketches</strong></h2>

			</figure>

			<p>
				<strong>Design Rationale for Sketch 1:</strong>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Addition of Color Variation</strong> For this visualization, the addition of Green, Yellow, and Red color was aimed to help communicate the 
					scale of new cases, along with the magnitude of the plot. As mentioned in lecture, color is difficult to discern subtles changes, but the ability for Color
					and magnitude to work together is helpful.</li>
				<li><strong> Inclusion of 7-Day Average outside the plot</strong> This was to increase clarity and discoverability of the fact that this is 7-Day averaged values.</li>
				<li><strong> Maintain Spiral Structure</strong> I wanted to maintain the spiral structure of the original plot, since I thought it was a unique way to visualize the data.
				However, I wanted to see if I could make it easier to follow the data by adding more color and labels. I will explore a non-spirla approach in the next plot</li>
			</ul>

			</figure>

			<p>
				<strong>Design Rationale for Sketch 2:</strong>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><Strong> Exploration of Concentric Circles</Strong> Building on the last visualization, I found the spiral approach difficult to read, 
				so I wanted to find another circular approach to visualize the data. I'd seen concentric circle plot similar to radar plots used, so I wanted
				 to explore this. I think it reduced my confusion of being able to follow a singular year of data, however it created new challenges of being able to 
				see the flow of data from December 2020 to January 2021.</li>
				<li><strong> Similarity to a Radar Graph</strong> This plot was inspired by radar graphs, which I thought might be an interesting themetic point, since 
					the US and the broader world was "at war" with COVID-19. I thought this might be a subtle way to connect the data to the theme of the pandemic. I'll
					try to connect further themetic elements in the later attempts.</li>
				<li><strong> Inclusion of every Month Label</strong> Although small, I wanted to observe how the inclusion of every month would effect the visualization.
				I liked this addition in a radial plot, since havin to interpolate months while some of the labels are backgrounds increases cognitive load since it will
			no longer be left to right labels. </li>

			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>Design Rationale for Sketch 3:</strong>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Combination of both years into a singular circle</strong> Continueing to try to "flatten" the spiraled inital plot, I want to see
				how the plot looks when we had one year on one half of the circle and another year on the other. This approach ruins the ability to see the 
				seasonality of the spikes, but does make it easier to follow.</li>
				<li><strong>Attempt at depicting the data as a Spike Protein for COVID-19</strong>This was my thematic attempt to get the visualization to
				look like a COVID-19 spike protein. It does not exactly look like a spike protein however it's at least a subtle connection to a shape many of us 
				are familiar. </li>
				<li><strong>Including the legend inside the graphic</strong> In an effort to make the graphic more self contained, I played with the ability
				to maintain all the descriptive data within the figure itself since it was circular. It ended up getting too busy inside, but I'll aim to 
				improve that in the computer driven design.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2><strong>Design Process & Design Decisions</strong></h2>

			<p>
				The goal of this plot is to provide a straightforward way to highlight the greatest peaks of new COVID-19 cases and to show that there was 
				often a smaller relative peak preceding each larger one. I found this fact interesting, and was the reason I wanted to continue working with the new 
				US Cases data instead of any of the other data in the dataset. I also found it interesting that there was a negative number of new cases on June 4th, 2021.
				This was not aparent in the original post, but was a clear outlier in the data when visualize in the new approach. I wanted to make sure that this was 
				still visible in the final plot. (I was unable to find an explanation for this negative number, but this would be a point of continued investigation).
				
				
				Importantly, this design subtly reminds the viewer of the spike protein after which COVID-19 
				is named. 
				The prominent "spikes" stand out as alarming elements, color-coded in red to indicate times of concern. I decided to keep the color associated 
				with the lowest amounts of new cases a yellow instead of a green as in the handwritten drafts to help signify that any new cases can be a danger to life. 
				I experimented with a logarithmic scale to better display the smaller spikes since these are seen as minimal in this plot. However, to 
				emphasize the peaks in the data, I decided to retain a linear scale. It's worth noting that the periodic nature and other patterns may be 
				obscured due to the circular shape, which can be 
				challenging for the eye to follow.Nonetheless, despite its simplicity, I believe the plot effectively meets the goal of illustrating periods of concern regarding new cases.

      <h3><strong>Reflection</strong></h3>

      <p>
        I really enjoyed creating my final product, as I believe it strikes a good balance between simplifying the plot's design and effectively conveying 
		the desired message. The biggest challenge I wish could be further explored is how to easily compare the seasonality of the data; this was a clear 
		advantage of the concentric circle and spiral plots but was lost when the years were consolidated into a single circle. However, transitioning to a 
		singular circle made the visualization significantly easier to read which addressed one of original critiques of the plot. I also think being able to 
		include the title, legend, and "7 day avg" information within the plot ensures that the viewer can quickly find all necessary context for the graph quickly,
		 which was also a previous critique. I think that combining the use of color with the plot's magnitude helped
		 communicate to a wider audience, accommodating different viewer preferences and considering potential colorblindness. This really helped the viewer 
		 find peaks even quicker than the original plot, really demonstrating the desired message without loosing clarity or simplicity. Overall, although the 
		 original plot 
		 was looking to address a different question, this final visualization was able to address many of the critiques that I had previous brought up.
