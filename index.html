			<h2>Reading & Critique</h2>

			<p>
				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><Strong> Cyclic Nature of New Cases: </Strong> Thi graphic shows that the new cases tended to spike every 5-8 months. This is interesting since 
					most infectious diseases tend to have a seasonal pattern, but this data shows a more cyclic pattern</li>
				<li><Strong> Peaks </Strong> The highest peak seems to be at the edge of the datasets limits in January 2022, at an estimate 300K cases</li>
				<li> <Strong>Troughs:</Strong> In terms of lowest new cases, June of the 2021 had the least amount of new cases. However, this led
				to large spike in September of 2021</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Critique:
			</p>
			Pluses:
			<ul>
				<li><Strong> Use of Color: </Strong> The use of a soft red was easy on the eyes and made it easy to differentiate the black center mean lines.</li>
				<li><Strong> Month-to-Month/Seasonal Comparison </Strong> The use of year long cycle makes it very easy to compare months and seasons of various years.</li>
				<li><Strong>Clear Labeling:</Strong> The labeling on this visualization was complete and clear. IT was able to identify which month and year each data 
				point was associated. The title and legend was also clear in it's communication of how to use it. </li>
			</ul>
			Deltas:
			<ul>
				<li><strong> Difficulty Quantifying values: </strong> This visualization is useful to communicate the general trends of the new cases,
					highs and lows, but it is difficult to quantify the exact number of cases at any given time. </li>
				</strong></li>
				<li><Strong> Range of Values: </Strong> The legend states that the data goes from 0 to 150K cases. However, it can be seen that January 2021, 
					and even more evidently January 2022 are larger than what is displayed on the legend. This causes confusion about what the legend is communicating.
				It is unclear whether it is communicating that the maximum size of the plot is 150K or that January 2022 extends beyond 150K.</li>
				<li><Strong> "7-Day Average" Label</Strong> The "7-day average" label may be better suited within the legend instead of as a label on the data.
					This method reduced visibility of this label since it seems to get lost and difficult to see in the main visualiztion. It also could cause confusion
				as to why the label is being applied to that data section in particular. </li>
				<li><Strong> Difficulty in reading Spiraled Data</Strong> It's difficult for the brain to follow spiraled data since it has a level of directionality 
					in two directions, both along the circle and based on the radius.I find it difficult to follow a year's pattern since my eye may jump to another year's data that is just on another spiral up.</li>

				<li> POSSIBLY NEED TO MAKE INTO PROSE</li>

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Addition of Color Variation</strong> For this visualization, the addition of Green, Yellow, and Red color was aimed to help communicate the 
					scale of new cases, along with the magnitude of the plot. As mentioned in lecture, color is difficult to discern subtles changes, but the ability for Color
					and magnitude to work together is helpful.</li>
				<li><strong> Inclusion of 7-Day Average outside the plot</strong> This was to increase clarity and discoverability of the fact that this is 7-Day averaged values.</li>
			</ul>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><Strong> Exploration of Concentric Circles</Strong> Building on the last visualization, I found the spiral approach difficult to read, 
				so I wanted to find another circular approach to visualize the data. I'd seen concentric circle plot similar to radar plots used, so I wanted
				 to explore this. I think it reduced my confusion of being able to follow a singular year of data, however it created new challenges of being able to 
				see the flow of data from December 2020 to January 2021.</li>
				<li><strong> Inclusion of every Month Label</strong> Although small, I wanted to observe how the inclusion of every month would effect the visualization.
				I liked this addition in a radial plot, since havin to interpolate months while some of the labels are backgrounds increases cognitive load since it will
			no longer be left to right labels. </li>

			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Combination of both years into a singular circle</strong> Continueing to try to "flatten" the spiraled inital plot, I want to see
				how the plot looks when we had one year on one half of the circle and another year on the other. This approach ruins the ability to see the 
				seasonality of the spikes, but does make it easier to follow.</li>
				<li><strong>Attempt at depicting the data as a Spike Protein for COVID-19</strong>This was my thematic attempt to get the visualization to
				look like a COVID-19 spike protein. It isn't an immediately obvious connection but it's at least a subtle connection to a shape many of us 
				are familiar. </li>
				<li><strong>Including the legend inside the graphic</strong> In an effort to make the graphic more self contained, I played with the ability
				to maintain all the descriptive data within the figure itself since it was circular. It ended up getting too busy inside, but I'll aim to 
				improve that in the computer driven design.</li>
			</ul>
