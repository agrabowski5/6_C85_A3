			<h2>Reading & Critique</h2>

			<p>
				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><Strong> Cyclic Nature of New Cases: </Strong> Thi graphic shows that the new cases tend to spike every 5-8 months. This is interesting since 
					most infectious diseases tend to have a seasonal pattern, but this data shows a more cyclic pattern</li>
				<li><Strong> Relatively Small Peaks leading Big Peaks: </Strong> The graphic shows that there is a consistent pattern of a smaller peak 
					before a larger peak. This is seen with the small July 2020 peak before the large January 2021 peak, and the September 2021 peak before 
					the even larger January 2022 peak.
				<li><Strong> Peaks </Strong> The highest peak seems to be at the edge of the datasets limits in January 2022, at an estimate 300K cases</li>
				<li><Strong>Troughs:</Strong> In terms of lowest new cases, June of the 2021 had the least amount of new cases. However, this led
				to large spike in September of 2021</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Critique:
			</p>
			Pluses:
			<ul>
				<li><Strong> Use of Color: </Strong> The use of a soft red was easy on the eyes and made it easy to differentiate the black center mean lines. I do believe
				color could be used more strategically to deliver the message.</li>
				<li><Strong> Month-to-Month/Seasonal Comparison </Strong> The use of year long cycle makes it very easy to compare months and seasons of various years.</li>
				<li><Strong>Clear Labeling:</Strong> The labeling on this visualization was complete and clear. It was able to identify which month and year each data 
				point was associated. The title and legend was also clear in it's communication of how to use it. </li>
			</ul>
			Deltas:
			<ul>
				<li><strong> Difficulty Quantifying values: </strong> This visualization is useful to communicate the general trends of the new cases,
					highs and lows, but it is difficult to quantify the exact number of cases at any given time. </li>
				</strong></li>
				<li><Strong> Range of Values: </Strong> The legend states that the data goes from 0 to 150K cases. However, it can be seen that January 2021, 
					and even more evidently January 2022 are larger than what is displayed on the legend. This causes confusion about what the legend is communicating.
				It is unclear whether it is communicating that the maximum size of the plot is 150K or that January 2022 extends beyond 150K.</li>
				<li><Strong> "7-Day Average" Label</Strong> The "7-day average" label may be better suited within the legend instead of as a label on the data.
					This method reduced visibility of this label since it seems to get lost and difficult to see in the main visualiztion. It also could cause confusion
				as to why the label is being applied to that data section in particular. </li>
				<li><Strong> Difficulty in reading Spiraled Data</Strong> It's difficult for the brain to follow spiraled data since it has a level of directionality 
					in two directions, both along the circle and based on the radius.I find it difficult to follow a year's pattern since my eye may jump to another year's data that is just on another spiral up.</li>

				<li> POSSIBLY NEED TO MAKE INTO PROSE</li>

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

      <figure>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Addition of Color Variation</strong> For this visualization, the addition of Green, Yellow, and Red color was aimed to help communicate the 
					scale of new cases, along with the magnitude of the plot. As mentioned in lecture, color is difficult to discern subtles changes, but the ability for Color
					and magnitude to work together is helpful.</li>
				<li><strong> Inclusion of 7-Day Average outside the plot</strong> This was to increase clarity and discoverability of the fact that this is 7-Day averaged values.</li>
			</ul>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><Strong> Exploration of Concentric Circles</Strong> Building on the last visualization, I found the spiral approach difficult to read, 
				so I wanted to find another circular approach to visualize the data. I'd seen concentric circle plot similar to radar plots used, so I wanted
				 to explore this. I think it reduced my confusion of being able to follow a singular year of data, however it created new challenges of being able to 
				see the flow of data from December 2020 to January 2021.</li>
				<li><strong> Inclusion of every Month Label</strong> Although small, I wanted to observe how the inclusion of every month would effect the visualization.
				I liked this addition in a radial plot, since havin to interpolate months while some of the labels are backgrounds increases cognitive load since it will
			no longer be left to right labels. </li>

			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Combination of both years into a singular circle</strong> Continueing to try to "flatten" the spiraled inital plot, I want to see
				how the plot looks when we had one year on one half of the circle and another year on the other. This approach ruins the ability to see the 
				seasonality of the spikes, but does make it easier to follow.</li>
				<li><strong>Attempt at depicting the data as a Spike Protein for COVID-19</strong>This was my thematic attempt to get the visualization to
				look like a COVID-19 spike protein. It isn't an immediately obvious connection but it's at least a subtle connection to a shape many of us 
				are familiar. </li>
				<li><strong>Including the legend inside the graphic</strong> In an effort to make the graphic more self contained, I played with the ability
				to maintain all the descriptive data within the figure itself since it was circular. It ended up getting too busy inside, but I'll aim to 
				improve that in the computer driven design.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				The goal of this plot is to provide a straightforward way to highlight the greatest peaks of new COVID-19 cases and to show that there was 
				always a smaller peak preceding each major one. I found this fact interesting, and was the reason I wanted to continue working with the new 
				US Cases data instead of any of the other data in the dataset. This design subtly reminds the viewer of the spike protein after which COVID-19 
				is named. 
				The prominent "spikes" stand out as alarming elements, color-coded in red to indicate times of concern. I decided to keep the color associated 
				with the lowest amounts of new cases a yellow instead of a green as in the handwritten drafts to help signify that any new cases can be a danger to life. 
				I experimented with a logarithmic scale to better display the smaller spikes since these are seen as minimal in this plot. However, to 
				emphasize the peaks in the data, I decided to retain a linear scale. It's worth noting that the periodic nature and other patterns may be 
				obscured due to the circular shape, which can be 
				challenging for the eye to follow.Nonetheless, despite its simplicity, I believe the plot effectively meets the goal of illustrating periods of concern regarding new cases.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        I really enjoyed creating my final product, as I believe it strikes a good balance between simplifying the plot's design and effectively conveying 
		the desired message. The biggest challenge I wish could be further explored is how to easily compare the seasonality of the data; this was a clear 
		advantage of the concentric circle and spiral plots but was lost when the years were consolidated into a single circle. However, transitioning to a 
		singular circle made the visualization significantly easier to read which addressed one of original critiques of the plot. I also think being able to 
		include the title, legend, and "7 day avg" information within the plot ensures that the viewer can quickly find all necessary context for the graph quickly,
		 which was also a previous critique. I think that combining the use of color with the plot's magnitude helped
		 communicate to a wider audience, accommodating different viewer preferences and considering potential colorblindness. This really helped the viewer 
		 find peaks even quicker than the original plot, really demonstrating the desired message without loosing clarity or simplicity. Overall, this final 
		 visualization was able to address many of the critiques, while addressing a slightly different question of the original plot.
