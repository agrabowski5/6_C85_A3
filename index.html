				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><Strong> Cyclic Nature of New Cases: </Strong> Thi graphic shows that the new cases tended to spike every 5-8 months. This is interesting since 
					most infectious diseases tend to have a seasonal pattern, but this data shows a more cyclic pattern</li>
				<li><Strong> Peaks </Strong> The highest peak seems to be at the edge of the datasets limits in January 2022, at an estimate 300K cases</li>
				<li> <Strong>Troughs:</Strong> In terms of lowest new cases, June of the 2021 had the least amount of new cases. However, this led
				to large spike in September of 2021</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Critique:
			</p>
			Pluses:
			<ul>
				<li><Strong> Use of Color: </Strong> The use of a soft red was easy on the eyes and made it easy to differentiate the black center mean lines.</li>
				<li><Strong> Month-to-Month/Seasonal Comparison </Strong> The use of year long cycle makes it very easy to compare months and seasons of various years.</li>
				<li><Strong>Clear Labeling:</Strong> The labeling on this visualization was complete and clear. IT was able to identify which month and year each data 
				point was associated. The title and legend was also clear in it's communication of how to use it. </li>
			</ul>
			Deltas:
			<ul>
				<li><strong> Difficulty Quantifying values: </strong> This visualization is useful to communicate the general trends of the new cases,
					highs and lows, but it is difficult to quantify the exact number of cases at any given time. </li>
				</strong></li>
				<li><Strong> Range of Values: </Strong> The legend states that the data goes from 0 to 150K cases. However, it can be seen that January 2021, 
					and even more evidently January 2022 are larger than what is displayed on the legend. This causes confusion about what the legend is communicating.
				It is unclear whether it is communicating that the maximum size of the plot is 150K or that January 2022 extends beyond 150K.</li>
				<li><Strong> "7-Day Average" Label</Strong> The "7-day average" label may be better suited within the legend instead of as a label on the data.
					This method reduced visibility of this label since it seems to get lost and difficult to see in the main visualiztion. It also could cause confusion
				as to why the label is being applied to that data section in particular. </li>

				<li> POSSIBLY NEED TO MAKE INTO PROSE</li>
